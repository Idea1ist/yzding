This is Yuanze Ding (丁远泽)'s home on the web. I am a third year graduate student in Caltech. My advisors are Prof. Fiona Harrison and Charles(Chuck) Steidel. I was a physics undergraduate at Wuhan University before coming to Caltech (BSc 2022).

I am interested in the most powerful objects in the Universe. I have been working on X-ray binary and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with X-ray satellites since I was an undergrad. My current research focuses on observational exploration of AGN activity in local mergers and intermediate redshift luminous quasars.
I use various instrument including Optical/IR IFU (OSIRIS, MUSE, KCWI) and X-ray (Swift, XMM-Newton, Chandra) to conduct spectral-imaging-timing analysis.
I have close collaboration with people working on high redshift star forming galaxy and Ly alpha radiative transfer, as well as radio astronomer doing Blazar sciences.
