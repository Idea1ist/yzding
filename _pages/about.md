I'm a Ph.D. student in the UC Berkeley [Department of Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) I use supercomputer simulations and data from big telescopes to try to better understand how the universe works. 

My speciality is galaxy formation, with a focus on low-mass galaxies. I'm also interested in binary stars, Milky Way stellar populations, and more generally, in developing new methods to extract information from data. My advisors are [Eliot Quataert](http://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~eliot/) and [Dan Weisz](http://dweisz.github.io/).

I was an undergrad at [Yale University](https://astronomy.yale.edu/), where I worked with [Marla Geha](http://www.astro.yale.edu/mgeha/). I graduated with a B.S. in astrophysics in 2016.
