This is Yuanze Ding (丁远泽)'s home on the web. I am a rising second year graduate student in Caltech. My advisor is Prof. Fiona Harrison. I was a physics undergraduate at Wuhan University before coming to Caltech (BSc 2022).

I am interested in the most powerful objects in the Universe. I have been working on X-ray binary and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) with X-ray satellites since I was an undergrad. My current research includes both theoretical and observational work, like modeling accretion disk reflection and studying AGN-Galaxy co-evolution with X-ray telescopes.
